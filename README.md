=======

a simple client, which lists the most recent posts from the public timeline. 

Each post should be rendered in a table view cell, with the most recent at the top.  
Each cell should contain the user's avatar (bonus if the corners are rounded)
Each cell should contain the poster's name in bold
Each cell should contain the post text, and be variable height, depending on the text size
Pull to refresh should be implemented to refresh the timeline
The list should scroll quickly, without dropping frames on an iPhone 5

The timeline can be fetched here:   https://alpha-api.app.net/stream/0/posts/stream/global
